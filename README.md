## Hi there I'm Jerika 👋

I'm from the Philippines but in 2019 I've moved to Germany where I now live.

🌱 I’m currently learning **Web Development** focusing on **REa.

<!-- Things that interest me are -->

<!-- I enjoy ... -->

So far, I've completed HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses in freeCodeCamp and Academind and have built a number of nice projects, a selection of which you can see below:

<div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
  <img src="web_food.png" width="310" height="310" alt="Web Food Page" style="display: inline" />
  <img src="travel_startpage.png" width="310" height="310" alt="Travel Page - Home Page" style="display: inline" />
  <img src="travel_destinations.png" width="310" height="310" alt="Travel Page - Destinations Page" style="display: inline" />
  <img src="tictactoe.png" width="310" height="310" alt="Tic Tac Toe" style="display: inline" />
</div>

**I'm currently looking 👀 for an entry level position in Software/Web Development, remote or hybrid.**
